# Oxide Crucible tools

Various scripts used for Crucible

## downstairs_daemon.sh
A highly custom script that starts three downstairs in a loop and will
keep them restarted when they are killed.  A bunch of assumptions are made
around where the region directory is and which ports the downstairs use.
You can pause the downstairs kill by creating the /tmp/ds_test/up file.
To stop the script all together, create the /tmp/ds_test/stop file.

After starting the downstairs, the user can hit enter and the script
will randomly kill (and then restart) a downstairs process.

If a downstairs dies for any other reason then being killed with the
generic default kill signal, the script will stop everything and leave
the logs behind in /tmp/ds_test/

## tracegw.d
This is a dtrace example script for counting IOs into and out of
crucible from the guest.  The way this works requires that crucible is
running before you run this, otherwise it won't find the probes.
```
sudo dtrace -s tools/tracegw.d
```

You start crucible, then run the above script.  When you are ready to see
results, hit Control-C and the final counts will be printed.

Here is an example of how it might look:
```
final:crucible alan$ sudo dtrace -s tools/tracegw.d
dtrace: system integrity protection is on, some features will not be available

^C
 read_start:1000    read_end:1000
 write_start:1000   write_end:1000
 flush_start:1000   flush_end:1000
```

## tracegw.d
This is a simple dtrace script that measures latency times for when a r/w/f
job is submitted to the internal upstairs work queue, to when that job has
completed and the notification was sent back to the guest.
```
sudo dtrace -s tools/perfgw.d
```

Here is an example of how it might look:
```
$ sudo dtrace -s tools/perfgw.d
dtrace: system integrity protection is on, some features will not be available

dtrace: script 'tools/perfgw.d' matched 6 probes
^C

## test_up.sh
A simple script that will start three downstairs, then run through some tests in
client/src/main.  It's an easy way to quickly run some simple tests without
having to spin up a bunch of things.  These tests are limited in their scope and
should not be considered substantial.

That's all for now!
