         *

         * to be sent to it.  If this is a new upstairs that has not yet
         * connected to a downstairs, then we will wait for the guest to send
         * us this message and pass it down to the downstairs.  If a downstairs
         * is reconnecting after having already been active, then we look at our
         * upstairs guest_io_ready() and, if the upstairs is ready, we send the
         * downstairs the message ourselves that they should promote to active.
         * For downstairs currently in Disconnected or New states, we move to
         * WaitActive, for Faulted or Offline states, we stay in that state..

         * matches with what we expect.  We next request RegionInfo from the
         * downstairs.
         *
         * NegotiationState::WaitForRegionInfo
         * -----------------------------------
         *       RegionInfoPlease  --->
         *                         <---  RegionInfo(r)
         *
         * At this point the upstairs looks to see what state the downstairs is
         * currently in.  It will be WaitActive, Faulted, or Offline.
         *
         * Depending on which state, we will either choose
         * NegotiationState::GetLastFlush or NegotiationState::GetExtentVersions
         * next.
         *
         * For the Offline state, the downstairs was connected and verified
         * and some point after that, the connection was lost.  To handle this
         * condition we want to know the last flush this downstairs had ACKd
         * so we can give it whatever work it missed.
         *
         * For WaitActive, it means this downstairs never was "Active" and we
         * have to go through the full compare of this downstairs with other
         * downstairs and make sure they are consistent.  To do that, we will
         * request extent versions and skip over NegotiationState::GetLastFlush.
         *
         * For Faulted, we don't know the condition of the data on the
         * Downstairs, so we transition this downstairs to LiveRepairReady.  We
         * also request extent versions and will have to repair this
         * downstairs, skipping over NegotiationState::GetLastFlush as well.
         *
         * NegotiationState::GetLastFlush (offline only)
         * ------------------------------
         *          Upstairs             Downstairs

         *
         * After receiving our last flush, we now move this downstairs state to
         * Replay and skip ahead to NegotiationState::Done
         *
         * NegotiationState::GetExtentVersions
         * (WaitActive and LiveRepairReady come here from WaitForRegionInfo)
         * -----------------------------------
         *          Upstairs             Downstairs
         *    ExtentVersionsPlease --->
         *                         <---  ExtentVersions(g, v, d)
         *
         * Now with the extent info, Upstairs calls process_downstairs() and
         * if no problems, sends connected=true to the up_listen() task,
         * we set the downstairs to DsState::WaitQuorum and we exit the
         * while loop.
         *
         * NegotiationState::Done
         * ----------------------
         *    Now the downstairs is ready to receive replay IOs from the
         *    upstairs. We set the downstairs to DsState::Replay and the while
