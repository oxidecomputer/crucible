         *
         * The negotiation flow starts as follows, with the value of the
         * negotiated variable on the left:
         *
         * NegotiationState::Start
         * -----------------------
         *          Upstairs             Downstairs
         *           HereIAm(...)  --->
         *                         <---  YesItsMe(...)
         *
         * At this point, a downstairs will wait for a PromoteToActive message
         * to be sent to it.  If this is a new upstairs that has not yet
         * connected to a downstairs, then we will wait for the guest to send
         * us this message and pass it down to the downstairs.  If a downstairs
         * is reconnecting after having already been active, then we look at our
         * upstairs guest_io_ready() and, if the upstairs is ready, we send the
         * downstairs the message ourselves that they should promote to active.
         * For downstairs currently in Disconnected or New states, we move to
         * WaitActive, for Faulted or Offline states, we stay in that state..
         *
         * NegotiationState::WaitForPromote
         * --------------------------------
         *    PromoteToActive(uuid)--->
         *                         <---  YouAreNowActive(uuid)
         *
         * YouAreNowActive includes information about the upstairs and session
         * ID and we do some sanity checking here to make sure it all still
         * matches with what we expect.  We next request RegionInfo from the
         * downstairs.
         *
         * NegotiationState::WaitForRegionInfo
         * -----------------------------------
         *       RegionInfoPlease  --->
         *                         <---  RegionInfo(r)
         *
         * At this point the upstairs looks to see what state the downstairs is
         * currently in.  It will be WaitActive, Faulted, or Offline.
         *
         * Depending on which state, we will either exit negotiation to replay
         * or continue with NegotiationState::GetExtentVersions next.
         *
         * For the Offline state, the downstairs was connected and verified
         * and some point after that, the connection was lost.  To handle this
         * condition we want to know the last flush this downstairs had ACKd
         * so we can give it whatever work it missed.
         *
         * For WaitActive, it means this downstairs never was "Active" and we
         * have to go through the full compare of this downstairs with other
         * downstairs and make sure they are consistent.  To do that, we will
         * request extent versions, instead of setting the last flush.
         *
         * For Faulted, we don't know the condition of the data on the
         * Downstairs, so we transition this downstairs to LiveRepairReady.  We
         * also request extent versions and will have to repair this
         * downstairs, skipping over LastFlush as well.
         *
         * Replay (offline only)
         * ------------------------------
         *          Upstairs             Downstairs
         *          LastFlush(lf)) --->
         *            [negotiation finishes]
         *          Replayed jobs  --->
         *
         * After sending our last flush, we now replay all saved jobs for this
         * Downstairs and skip ahead to NegotiationState::Done.  Note that the
         * Downstairs does not reply to `LastFlush`; it simply sets the internal
         * `last_flush` state in the Downstairs.  Not having the Downstairs
         * reply means that there's no window in which we could become
         * ineligible for replay.
         *
         * NegotiationState::GetExtentVersions
         * (WaitActive and LiveRepairReady come here from WaitForRegionInfo)

         *
         * Now with the extent info, Upstairs calls process_downstairs() and
         * if no problems, sends connected=true to the up_listen() task,
         * we set the downstairs to DsState::WaitQuorum and we exit the
         * while loop.
         *
         * NegotiationState::Done
         * ----------------------
         *    Now the downstairs is ready to receive replay IOs from the
         *    upstairs. We set the downstairs to DsState::Active and the while
         *    loop is exited.
