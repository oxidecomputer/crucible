     *    "Active" and we have to go through the full compare of this
     *    downstairs with other downstairs and make sure they are
     *    consistent (This code still TBW).  The New/Disconnected steps
     *    continue here:
     *
     *          Upstairs             Downstairs
     * 4: ExtentVersionsPlease --->
     *                         <---  ExtentVersions(g, v, d)
     *
     *    Now with the extent info, Upstairs calls process_downstairs() and
     *    if no problems, sends connected=true to the up_listen() task,
     *    we set the downstairs to DsState::WaitQuorum and we exit the
     *    while loop.
     *
     *    For the "Offline" state, the downstairs was connected and verified
     *    and after that point the connection was lost.  To handle this
     *    condition we follow these final steps to get this downstairs
     *    working again:
     *
     *          Upstairs             Downstairs
     * 3:       LastFlush(lf)) --->
     *                         <---  LastFlushAck(lf)
     *
     * 5: Now the downstairs is ready to receive replay IOs from the
     *    upstairs. We set the downstairs to DsState::Replay and the while
     *    loop is exited.
