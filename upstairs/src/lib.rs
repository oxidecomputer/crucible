/// it to internal work queues, including the work queue for the three
/// downstairs tasks that are responsible for sending IO to each
/// downstairs.  This probe firing does not mean that a downstairs task
/// has received or is acting on the IO yet, it just means the notification
/// has been sent.
///
/// ds__*__io__start: This is when a downstairs task puts an IO on the
/// wire to the actual downstairs that will do the work. This probe has
/// both the job ID and the client ID so we can tell the individual
/// downstairs apart.
///
/// ds__*__io_done: An ACK has been received from a downstairs for an IO
/// sent to it. At the point of this probe the IO has just come off the
/// wire and we have not processed it yet.
///
/// up__to__ds__*__done: (Upstairs__to__Downstairs) This is the point where
/// the upstairs has decided that it has enough data to complete an IO
/// and send an ACK back to the guest.  For a read, this could be the the
/// first IO to respond from the downstairs.  For a write/flush, we have
/// two downstairs that have ACK'd the IO.
///
/// gw__*__done: An IO is completed and the Upstairs has sent the
/// completion notice to the guest.

     * how the upstairs is notified that a DS is new or moving, or other
     * things, this way will work. We will revisit when we have more info.
     *
     * The negotiation flow starts as follows, with the value of the

     *
     * NegotiationState::Start
     * -----------------------
     *          Upstairs             Downstairs
     *           HereIAm(...)  --->
     *                         <---  YesItsMe(...)
     *
     * At this point, a downstairs will wait for a PromoteToActive message
     * to be sent to it.  If this is a new upstairs that has not yet
     * connected to a downstairs, then we will wait for the guest to send
     * us this message and pass it down to the downstairs.  If a downstairs
     * is reconnecting after having already been active, then we look at our
     * upstairs guest_io_ready() and, if the upstairs is ready, we send the
     * downstairs the message ourselves that they should promote to active.
     * For downstairs currently in Disconnected or New states, we move to
     * WaitActive, for Faulted or Offline states, we stay in that state..
     *
     * NegotiationState::WaitForPromote
     * --------------------------------
     *    PromoteToActive(uuid)--->
     *                         <---  YouAreNowActive(uuid)
     *
     * YouAreNowActive includes information about the upstairs and session
     * ID and we do some sanity checking here to make sure it all still
     * matches with what we expect.  We next request RegionInfo from the
     * downstairs.
     *
     * NegotiationState::WaitForRegionInfo
     * -----------------------------------
     *       RegionInfoPlease  --->
     *                         <---  RegionInfo(r)
     *
     * At this point the upstairs looks to see what state the downstairs is
     * currently in.  It will be WaitActive, Faulted, or Offline.
     *
     * Depending on which state, we will either choose
     * NegotiationState::GetLastFlush or NegotiationState::GetExtentVersions
     * next.
     *
     * For the Offline state, the downstairs was connected and verified
     * and some point after that, the connection was lost.  To handle this
     * condition we want to know the last flush this downstairs had ACKd
     * so we can give it whatever work it missed.
     *
     * For WaitActive, it means this downstairs never was "Active" and we
     * have to go through the full compare of this downstairs with other
     * downstairs and make sure they are consistent.  To do that, we will
     * request extent versions and skip over NegotiationState::GetLastFlush.
     *
     * For Faulted, we don't know the condition of the data on the
     * Downstairs, so we transition this downstairs to LiveRepairReady.  We
     * also request extent versions and will have to repair this
     * downstairs, skipping over NegotiationState::GetLastFlush as well.
     *
     * NegotiationState::GetLastFlush (offline only)
     * ------------------------------
     *          Upstairs             Downstairs
     *          LastFlush(lf)) --->
     *                         <---  LastFlushAck(lf)
     *
     * After receiving our last flush, we now move this downstairs state to
     * Replay and skip ahead to NegotiationState::Done
     *
     * NegotiationState::GetExtentVersions
     * (WaitActive and LiveRepairReady come here from WaitForRegionInfo)
     * -----------------------------------
     *          Upstairs             Downstairs
     *    ExtentVersionsPlease --->
     *                         <---  ExtentVersions(g, v, d)
     *
     * Now with the extent info, Upstairs calls process_downstairs() and
     * if no problems, sends connected=true to the up_listen() task,
     * we set the downstairs to DsState::WaitQuorum and we exit the
     * while loop.
     *
     * NegotiationState::Done
     * ----------------------
     *    Now the downstairs is ready to receive replay IOs from the
     *    upstairs. We set the downstairs to DsState::Replay and the while
     *    loop is exited.

/**
 * This method is a task that will loop forever and wait for three
 * downstairs to get into the ready state. We are notified of that through
 * the ds_status_rx channel.  Once we have three connections, we then also
 * listen for work requests to come over the guest channel.
 *
 * The ds_reconcile_done channel is used during reconciliation to indicate
 * to this task (in the ds_reconcile() function) that a downstairs has
 * completed a reconcile request.
 *
 * This task drives any reconciliation if necessary.  If Repair is required,
 * it happens in three phases.  Typically an interruption of repair will
 * result in things starting over, but if actual repair work to an extent
 * is completed, that extent won't need to be repaired again.
 *
 * The three phases are:
 *
 * Collect:
 * When a Downstairs connects, the Upstairs collects the gen/flush/dirty
 * (GFD) info from all extents.  This GFD information is stored and the
 * Upstairs waits for all three Downstairs to attach.
 *
 * Compare:
 * In the compare phase, the upstairs will walk the list of all extents
 * and compare the G/F/D from each of the downstairs.  When there is a
 * mismatch between downstairs (The dirty bit counts as a mismatch and will
 * force a repair even if generation and flush numbers agree). For each
 * mismatch, the upstairs determines which downstairs has the extent that
 * should be the source, and which of the other downstairs extents needs
 * repair. This list of mismatches (source, destination(s)) is collected.
 * Once an upstairs has compiled its repair list, it will then generates a
 * sequence of Upstairs ->  Downstairs repair commands to repair each
 * extent that needs to be fixed.  For a given piece of repair work, the
 * commands are:
 * - Send a flush to source extent.
 * - Close extent on all downstairs.
 * - Send repair command to destination extents (with source extent
 *   IP/Port).
 * (See DS-DS Repair)
 * - Reopen all extents.
 *
 * Repair:
 * During repair Each command issued from the upstairs must be completed
 * before the next will be sent. The Upstairs is responsible for walking
 * the repair commands and sending them to the required downstairs, and
 * waiting for them to finish.  The actual repair work for an extent
 * takes place on the downstairs being repaired.
 *
 * Repair (ds to ds)
 * Each downstairs runs a repair server (Dropshot) that listens for
 * repair requests from other downstairs.  A downstairs with an extent
 * that needs repair will contact the source downstairs and request the
 * list of files for an extent, then request each file.  Once all files
 * are local to the downstairs needing repair, it will replace the existing
 * extent files with the new ones.
