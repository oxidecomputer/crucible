# Crucible project status and open source

The Crucible repo is public because it has always been our intention to
make this open-source.  We thought it was important to explain where we're
currently at, and manage your expectations.

- We are a small company.

- Our current goal is support our first generation products.

- We're writing Crucible in support of that goal, not as its own thing. We're
  all working on the products, and block storage is an important product
  feature.

- Crucible itself has dependencies on many other Oxide repositories, which
  themselves are undergoing a similar development churn.

- These points together mean that we may not have enough bandwidth to review
  and integrate outside PRs right now.  We hope this will change in the future.

You're welcome to send PRs, but we want to set expectations right: if we have
time, or if the PRs are very small or fix bugs, we may integrate them in the
near future.  But we might also not get to any PR for a while, by which time it
might no longer be relevant.

We've all dealt with those open source projects that feel open in name only, and
have big patches and history-free source drops appearing from behind the walls
of some large organization. We don't like that, and we're not going to do that.
But it will take some time for us to scale up -- please bear with us.

If you want to ask about whether a PR is consistent with our short-term plan
_before_ you put in the work -- and you should! -- hit us up on the repo
Discussions tab on GitHub.

Thanks!
